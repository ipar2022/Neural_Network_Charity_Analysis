# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

- Overview of the analysis
- Alphabet Soup is a lending company. In order to determine if applicants will receive funding machine learning and neural networks were used. 

- Results

- Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
  The main variable of focus IS_SUCCESSFUL was the objective for this model.
 


- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
  Additional variables that were the focus of this model was 
  APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS.

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
  Two variables were droped from the model EIN and NAME.

- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
